# CreeThor
Name origins from the native american clan Cree and the Assa god Thor, which together is pronounced "Creator".
### This is a Laustrup project of creating a game engine running in Java with Maven and dependencies of lwjgl with GLFW and openGL.

#### A lot of inspiration has been received from Gabe Ambrosio, where the tutorial can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE&index=1).
#### Some of Laustrup's own dependencies are in use, such as:

* [Utilities](https://github.com/Laustrup/Utilities/tree/master/Maven)

* [Quality Assurance](https://github.com/Laustrup/QualityAssurance/tree/master/Maven)
